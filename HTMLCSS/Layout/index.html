            As we know that the main source of bhuddism is to meditate via yoga
            and peace and spending some sort of time with
            <strong>mother earth</strong> via connecting naturally. The Buddha
            was said to be critical of worship, in fact. In one scripture
            (Sigalovada Sutta, Digha Nikaya 31) he encountered a young man
            engaged in a Vedic worship practice. The Buddha told him important
            in a responsible, ethical way than to worship anything.

            he Second Truth tells us dukkha has a cause. The immediate cause is
            craving, and the craving comes from not understanding reality and
            not knowing ourselves. Because we misunderstand ourselves we are

            was the way to elevate the mind and that the door to wisdom was
            found at the edge of de ath. However, after six years of this, the
            pri nce felt only frustration. Eventually, he realized that t he
            path to peace was through mental discipline. At Bodh Ga ya, in the
