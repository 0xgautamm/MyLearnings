      As we know that the main source of bhuddism is to meditate via yoga and
      peace and spending some sort of time with
      <strong>mother earth</strong> via connecting naturally.
      The Buddha was said to be critical of worship, in fact. In one scripture (Sigalovada Sutta, Digha Nikaya 31) he encountered a young 
      man engaged in a Vedic worship practice. The Buddha told him 
       important  in a responsible, ethical way than to worship anything.

        and not knowing ourselves. Because we misunderstand 
        ourselves we are riddled with anxiety and frustration.
         We experience life in a narrow, self-centered way,
          going through life craving things we think will make us happy. </p>
